A personal project that uses C#/.NET to execute a fun little command-line interface typing game.

# This project is a work in progress and is not completely functional yet.

You will need to have the .NET framework installed and compile/build the source code yourself. Theoretically all you should need to do it execute "dotnet run" from the command-line inside your local repo too run the program.

There are no non-standard dependancies and it should work with .NET 8 (and possibly earlier versions) straight out of the box.

Read the SRS in the docs folder for more detailed information on the functionalty of the application and how it works.
