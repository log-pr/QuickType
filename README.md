A small personal project that uses .NET to execute a fun little command-line interface typing game.

#This is project is a work in progress and is not completely functional yet.

You will need to have the .NET framework installed and compile/build the application yourself. This should be trivial as all you should need to do it run "dotnet run" from the command-line inside your local repo.

There are no non-standard dependancies and it should work with .NET 8 (and likely earlier versions) straight out of the box.

Read the SRS in the docs folder for more detailed information.
